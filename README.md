## ⚔️ Rules of the Game

* 🎯 Treat each level as a **sprint (2 weeks)**.
* 📌 Solve → Review → Document → Share.
* 📝 Keep a **retrospective log** after each sprint.
* 🎉 Every level cleared = reward myself (small treat, hobby time, etc.).

---

## 🌟 Why Public?

* 📢 To stay **accountable**.
* 👥 To connect with others preparing for similar goals.
* 💡 To inspire consistency by showing progress openly.
