# 🎮 Stripe SDE Prep Journey — “Game Mode”

## **Level 0 – Setup (Tutorial Stage)**

🎯 Goal: Build the environment, set rules.

* Choose your **main language** (Java / Python / C++).
* Set up **LeetCode, GitHub, Notion/Jira board (Kanban)**.
* Create 3 Kanban columns: **To Do | In Progress | Done**.

💡 *Reward: You officially start the game.*

---

## **Level 1 – Core Skills (Foundation World)**

🎯 Goal: Master basics of programming + DSA fundamentals.

* Arrays, Strings, HashMaps.
* Linked List, Stack, Queue.
* 30–40 LeetCode Easy/Medium problems.

🔑 Agile Sprint: 2 weeks (daily 2 problems + review).
💡 *Reward: Unlock confidence in writing bug-free code fast.*

---

## **Level 2 – Algorithmic Patterns (Challenge World)**

🎯 Goal: Recognize and solve common patterns.

* Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Binary Search, Recursion, Backtracking.
* Trees, Graph BFS/DFS.
* 50–60 problems across these patterns.

🔑 Sprint: 3–4 weeks (mix of mediums + 1–2 hards).
💡 *Reward: You unlock the “Problem-Solver Badge.”*

---

## **Level 3 – Boss Fight 1: DSA Mock Battles**

🎯 Goal: Simulate real interviews.

* Weekly mock interviews (Pramp / Interviewing.io / peer).
* Time-box LeetCode problems (45 min → 30 min → 20 min).

💡 *Reward: You beat the first boss (DSA stage).*

---

## **Level 4 – System Design (Architecture World)**

🎯 Goal: Learn to think like an engineer at scale.

* **Low-Level Design (LLD):** OOP, design patterns, mini-projects (e.g., design a parking lot).
* **High-Level Design (HLD):** APIs, databases, caching, queues, scalability.
* Study Stripe-like problems: *“Design a payments API,” “Design fraud detection.”*

🔑 Sprint: 4–6 weeks, alternating between DSA + design.
💡 *Reward: You unlock the “Architect Badge.”*

---

## **Level 5 – Stripe Domain Knowledge (Stripe World)**

🎯 Goal: Know Stripe inside out.

* Learn products: Payments, Connect, Atlas.
* Understand PCI compliance, API security basics.
* Read Stripe’s engineering blog (real case studies).

💡 *Reward: You gain the “Stripe Insider Badge.”*

---

## **Level 6 – Boss Fight 2: System + Behavioral**

🎯 Goal: Mock full interview rounds.

* Round 1: DSA (timed).
* Round 2: LLD/HLD.
* Round 3: Behavioral (*Tell me about a time you…*).

💡 *Reward: You’re interview-ready.*

---

## **Level 7 – Final Boss: Stripe Onsite Simulation**

🎯 Goal: Do a **full Stripe-style mock onsite** (4–5 rounds in 1–2 days).

* Rotate between DSA, System Design, Coding, Behavioral.
* After each, do a **retro** (Agile style): What went well? What can improve?

💡 *Reward: You “clear the game” and unlock the **Stripe SDE Offer.***

# 🔄 Agile / Kanban Tips

* **Daily Stand-up (5 min):** What did I solve yesterday? What’s today? What’s blocked?
* **Sprint Length:** 2 weeks → review progress at end.
* **Backlog:** Keep problems/resources you haven’t touched yet.
* **Demo Day:** End of each level, showcase progress (solve a hard problem live, or design a mini project).

---

⚔️ Think of it like:

* **LeetCode = Training Ground**
* **Mock Interviews = Mini Boss Battles**
* **System Design = Advanced Dungeon**
* **Stripe Knowledge = Secret Map**
* **Onsite = Final Boss Fight**

# 🎯 **Kanban Board Setup**

### Columns:

1. **Backlog (Locked Quests)**
2. **To Do (Next Up)**
3. **In Progress (Grinding XP)**
4. **Review (Boss Checkpoint)**
5. **Done (Quest Completed 🎉)**
